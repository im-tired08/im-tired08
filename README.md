- 🌱 i’m currently learning several languages, including html, css, javascript, python, and c++. i'm at the very basics with JS, python, and c++ and can't do much with them. i'm able to do some fairly rudimentary/simple things with html/css, i can put together a web page that looks 15 years out of date :P
