- 👋 Hi, I’m @im-tired08
- 👀 I’m interested in music (jazz, rock, blues, metal, country, folk, ska, classical), trains, coding/programming (duh), broader tech, gaming, history, and weather/meteorology!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning several languages, including html, css, javascript, python, and c++. i'm at the very basics with JS, python, and c++ and can't do much with them. i'm able to do some fairly rudimentary/simple things with html/css, i can put together a web page that looks 15 years out of date :P
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much right now, busy with school
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is harperpayne1005@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/they, can be used interchangeably
- ⚡ Fun fact: i have a special extra tooth that looks like a claw! its called a talon cusp and is a rare dental anomaly that .04-8% of people have
